# CAS CS 541 Applied Machine Learnig

This course is a rigorous introduction to machine learning concepts, techniques, and algorithms. Covers practical skills in machine learning including techniques for clustering, classification, regression, feature selection, and model compression. Emphasizes hands-on application of methods via programming on real- world datasets.



**Course Prerequisites**

This is a graduate course (open to upper-level undergraduates) and requires the following:

- Linear algebra (CAS CS 132 or MA 242 or equivalent)

- Probability/Statistics (CAS CS 237 or MA 381 or 581 or equivalent)
- Comfort with programming in Python (eg, CAS CS 111 and 112, or equivalent)

- Familiarity with calculus

The main graded work for the course is the problem sets, class participation, quizzes, and final challenge. There will be five problem sets (ps1-ps5), each consisting of written and programming problems, and five multiple choice quizzes for each major topic covered.
